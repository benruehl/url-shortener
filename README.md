# url-shortener

MVP to demonstrate URL shortening in [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) + Kotlin

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/releases/)

For local development, an appropriate IDE should have these included already.

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `benruehl.urlshortener.UrlShortenerApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively, you can start the application from your command line like so:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```
